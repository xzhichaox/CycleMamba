Official PyTorch code for 'CycleMamba: Cycle-Consistent Learning for Aerial Visible-to-Infrared Image Translation'

Pytorch implementation for our aerial visible-to-infrared image translation method. With the proposed Cycle-Consistent framework, we are able to learn the mapping from visible image to infrared image. Thus, high-quality image translation can be achieved.
