# CycleMamba
Official PyTorch code for ''CycleMamba: Cycle-Consistent Learning for Aerial Visible-to-Infrared Image Translation''
Pytorch implementation for our image-to-image translation method. With the proposed Cycle-Consistent framework, we are able to learn **diverse** image-to-image translation from **unpaired** training data.
