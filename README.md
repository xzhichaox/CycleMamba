# CycleMamba
Official PyTorch code for 'CycleMamba: Cycle-Consistent Learning for Aerial Visible-to-Infrared Image Translation'.

Our code will be published after the article is accepted.

#Pytorch implementation for our aerial visible-to-infrared image translation method. With the proposed Cycle-Consistent framework, we are able to learn the mapping from visible image to infrared image. Thus, high-quality image translation can be achieved.
